###Personal Beliefs
Just my two cents, taken with a grain of salt.

Champion Elitism, against Populism and Welfarism;  
Believe in Jevons' Subjective theory of value, against Marx's value theory;   
Support Free Market and Free Trade partially regulated by government; oppose Communism and Planned Economy;  
Advocate contextual Leadership, desiring to construct or participate in High-Performance Team; turn down the thumb on Heroism;  
Believe in Intelligence Amplification, object to pure Artificial Intelligence, but not oppose Technological Singularity.   
  
Last but not least, I could be false and you could be true, but through efforts, we can approach to the truth.
