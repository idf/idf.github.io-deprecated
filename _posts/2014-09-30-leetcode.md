Today marks the accomplishment of 152 [LeetCode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/) questions in Python. It took about 60 days during my final academic year autumn semester (I guess never too late to catch up, huh?). I attempted 1 to 3 questions every day and had been keeping doing it for 60 days. Strangely, coding gradually becomes a natural part of life as other everyday activity like reading news and blogs. Surprisingly, during these 60 days, I even got my GRE done and TOEFL done. It feels terrific to be productive and do something meaningful.  

The LeetCode Python solutions are in github repo [github.com/zhangdanyangg/LeetCode](https://github.com/zhangdanyangg/LeetCode). You are more than welcomed to take a look at it and discuss.
