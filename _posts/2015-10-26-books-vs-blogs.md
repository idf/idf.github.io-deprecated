I used to read lots of blogs and write many of them, but recently I made the change to read more books and write some. A [book](https://github.com/algorhythms/Algo-Quicksheet) I am currently writing is for Algorithms. 

Knowledge is a tree. Some knowledge like principles are main branches that I should remember by heart; while some knowledge like minutiae are just leaves that should not consume much of my attentions. The details can be easily retrieved using modern search engines. 

Knowledge is a system. Modularizing different parts of the knowledge helps me for the information retrieval. The interfaces (i.e. API) of different modules helps to solve greater problems. Modules should be abstracted and be viewed in aeriality when solving the problem in high level. Modules should be open to see their details when implementing the solution to the problem. 

Knowledge is not a time line. Knowledge sorted in chronological order are less useful than that classified into different modules that form a system. Usually, blogs are written in chronological order and contain pieces drawn from the unknown knowledge system; thus, blogs contain far less information than books. 

Knowledge should be learnt in a systematic approach. The most prominent way is reading book since book is inherently systematic. 

Knowledge should be reflected. Refreshing the knowledge helps strengthen the modules of the system and interactions among them. Blogs can be effective way to serve this purpose. By reading and commenting a blog, knowledge is refreshed and becomes lively functioning. 

That is about how to learn in a systematic approach.
