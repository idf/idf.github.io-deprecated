Python is an elegant language, and you can develop and tweak the scripts to suit your needs without going through the tedious process of compilation as in Java.  

However, Python does not make exception handling compulsory like IOException in Java; therefore Python causes me a lot of headache when I run the Python codes in production stage. The code constantly breaks down half way through the execution, since the there are much more of unexpected exceptions in the real-world deployment than development. Although Java is not so productive as Python, the compulsory compile time exception handling saves a lot of troubles after deployment and make the product more robust.  

Admittedly, it is also possible that I am not a Python expert thus my scripts constantly broke. But it is a lot of fun debugging. :)
