Chromium 64bit has compatibility issues with [Adobe Flash](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/?no_redirect) and keeps saying that "shockwave has crashed". Additionally, it cannot use the pdf previewer ([pdf.dll](http://crportable.sourceforge.net/Docs/InstallingPlugins)) from Chrome 32bit.  

Conclusively, I guess Chromium 32bit suits me better.
