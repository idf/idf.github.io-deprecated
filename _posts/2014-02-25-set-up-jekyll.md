Set up Jekyll in Linux is much more easier, but anyway in Windows:  

Quick start at [Here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)  
To run portable version of Jekyll localhost on Windows, follow [this](http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2013/07/20/buildportablejekyll.html)  
Or if you got the ruby environment, follow [this](http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2011/09/01/runningjekyllwindows.html)  

Recommend to run porttable version, unless you want to go through the installation ordeal as me
