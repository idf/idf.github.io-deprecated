###Band of Brothers

Lt. Dike was not a bad leader because he made bad decisions. He was a bad leader because he made no decisions.

Episode 7 of Band of Brother illustrates an example of poor leadership by protraiting Lieutenant Dike, a Westpoint graduate. He ends up placing his entire band of men in jeopardy because he cannot make decisions.  

In reality, almost every professional team is like a band of brothers, requiring a influential and inspiring leadership, under which the team's existence purpose - solving the existing problems or inventing something non-existing - shall be fulfilled. 

Leaders should lead, envision the objective for the team, and clarify the team roles for the members. On the other hand, leaders should not lead too much, not give every specific instructions to the members, or not empower members to have the freedom to construct their own solutions to reach the target.  

###Goal Setting
Among other team leading techniques, the single most important one is "Goal Setting". According to this [book][1], the goal setting is an effective tool for pushing the entire team's progress by communicating to every member in a team with a common goal and ensure they are clearly aware of what is expected from them.  

One not uncommon counterexample of the goal setting is that the leader tells every specific instruction to the member about how to do the staff without clarifying why he needs to do this, just like hard-coding an algorithm into a computer and expecting the computer will repeatedly follow the instructions.  Computers are not like humans since they do not have an intrinsic motivation of carrying out the task at least for now unless [AI-complete][2] is achieved. Humans are of high-intelligence, and more importantly are self-motivated. According to Daniel Pink's [Drive][3], a task requiring heuristic thinking (e.g. creative task) rather than algorithmic thinking demands much more self-motivation since people are doing it for the sake of doing it rather than for any external benefits and under intrinsic motivation people will outperform themselves. Here is an enlightening [Video][4] of illustrating Motivation 2.0.  

Along with the booming of Computer Science and information processing automation, the number of algorithmic tasks is dramatically declining. Humans are freed from routine and mundane tasks to do more heuristic tasks thanks to the advancement of technology. Software development and consulting are typical examples of heuristic tasks. Leaders in the 21st century should leverage on the goal-setting theory to set the common direction for the team to execute those heuristic tasks. 

###Leaders' Power
Leaders normally have 3 most fundamental power bases: Coercive power, Expert power, and Referent power. There are actually 5 power bases under [French and Raven's theory][5] (1959). But here I only discuss the most basic 3 in my opinion.  

Coercive power is definitely the worst power for the leader to exercise provided that he is leading a high-performance team performing heuristic tasks, since it will result in only compliance instead of commitment. 

Expert power is a must if the leader is leading a software development project or consulting services. Without it, the foundation of leadership is hard to built, because it is not uncommon you hear other people questioning about the technical competence of their leaders. However, a leader cannot know everything about the tasks; otherwise he does not need a high-performance team to make the progress thus outsourcing everything is a more desirable approach. 

Referent power comes into play since a leader cannot possess all the expertises and information. A leader should in some way be influential and inspiring. The most effective leader is one who can boost the morale and performance of team members and produce a collective identify for the team. With members' admiration and respect, the leader should idealized a vision for the team about what shall be achieved and challenge the intellectual limits of members and let them take the ownership of what they have achieved.

Consequently, by aligning the members' motivations and goals to the team's overall goal using both Expert power and Referent power (sometimes Coercive power in case of emergency), along with setting [SMART goals][6], a leader will lead his high-performance team to victory.
