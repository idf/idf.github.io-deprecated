I first encounter the saying "I'm a Human and Don't Scale" in the [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)'s blog. Dan Abramov is the major contributor to React and the author of Redux.

# Horizontal Scalability
For a website, when facing increasingly number of users, we have two options to scale: either upgrade the server to a more powerful one or add more machines. The first option is called vertical scaling while the second one is called horizontal scaling.

As a human, combined with intelligence, we can gain more knowledge by learning, so as to make ourselves more powerful and productive. We can easily vertically scale ourselves. However, like an individual machine, a single human can't scale horizontally by being alone.

# Non-Exponential Growth
In Finance, when an investment generates return, the interests are compounded; therefore, an exponential growth.

The size of principal doesn't affect the return rate. The fund/investment strategy generates 5% return on $100,000 still can also easily generate 5% on $1,000,000. The investment can be characterized as of horizontal scalability and exponential growth.

As a human, the learning procedure is more like linear - the more time you spend, the more knowledge you gain; but the procedure is far away from being exponential.

# Impact
As a human, we cannot horizontally scale ourselves; but we can scale our impact via multiple means.

## Software
We can encapsulate our knowledge and intelligence into software. Software itself is inherently scalable. Software as a vehicle, our intelligence can easily serve one additional user by installing the software on her device without much cost.

## Leadership
Have a vision, build a team, hit milestones, and scale the team into a corporation. Multiple people with consistent mission in mind can scale the impact.
