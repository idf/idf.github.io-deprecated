Boom! [Raymond](https://github.com/raymondjacobson), [Yiyang](https://github.com/yuan3y) and [I](https://github.com/zhangdanyangg) went to Facebook Hackathon on the 1st Weekend of February 2015. So much fun developing [Picspective](https://github.com/zhangdanyangg/picspective) for 24 hours. We sparked the name on the bus trip to the office. Picked up Angular services the night before and on that day we became full-fledged web developers! Quite weird but awesome to use Google staffs in Facebook's event.
